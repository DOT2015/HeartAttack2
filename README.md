# 🫀 Heart Attack Predictor

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on health and lifestyle data.

## 🔍 Overview

The model is trained on a preprocessed dataset containing features such as:

- Demographics (Sex, Age, Race, etc.)
- Health status (BMI, Sleep Hours, Chronic Conditions)
- Lifestyle factors (Smoking, Alcohol, Physical Activity)
- Medical history (Checkups, Vaccinations)

We evaluate multiple models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Neural Network (MLP)

SMOTE is applied to balance the target classes.
